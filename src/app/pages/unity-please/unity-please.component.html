	<h1>Unity Please!</h1>
</div>
<p>
	Wikipedia states there are over 38,000 different Christian denominations. How many?! There are two schools of thought on this; one school that thinks this is a good thing and the other that thinks this is very bad. Those that consider this good speak of how each person and personality can find their own expression in God and that is why there is so many. I do not adhere to this view because it seeks to put humans with their likes, whims, and preferences at the center of the church.
</p>
<p>
	Jesus prayed thus, <b><i>“And I do not pray for these alone, but for those also who shall believe on Me through their word, that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And I have given them the glory which You have given Me, that they may be one, even as We are one, I in them, and You in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them as You have loved Me.”</i>-John 17:20-23</b> Does this sound like Jesus intended to have 38,000 differences? Let’s be honest, it is not diversity, it is division. Right now the Lion’s Club has more unity than the church of Jesus, the Cripps and the Bloods have more unity than the church! No wonder the world struggles to believe in Jesus when the only unity His church has is the mere attempt at human unity= DIVISION. Jesus taught us the world would believe in God if they could see the oneness of the disciples. What are they seeing now?
</p>
<p>
	Let me tell you a little story and then you can tell me what God’s unity looks like. A family moves to a town, not big, but unfamiliar to them. Being disciples of Jesus, they naturally think about what church they want to be a part of in their new town. With “church shopping” in mind, they begin in the yellow pages (Yea, yea, they were older and did not use the internet). To their surprise, they only found one listing for Jesus’ church, not pages upon pages of different churches all claiming to be one in Jesus. It struck the father as odd, and he called the number with interest. Upon answer and a bit of greetings, he came right to the point, “Where are all the other churches?” The brother of the unified church was used to such questions and prepared for response. “How many churches should there be in Christ?” The caller was brought up short, because he knew Jesus wanted unity among the followers, but he had just never seen it. The unified brother went on to say there were more than one congregation, but that the church was one because they had endeavored to keep the unity of the Spirit, not the unity of fallen humanity. The Scriptures only speak of the church singular, not plural.
</p>
<p>
	Which way would show God is among us; many churches with different doctrines, practices, beliefs, and isolation from one another; or a church one as the Father is with the Son? Jesus must be teaching us to see revival in that we be one, so that the world may believe.
</p>
<p>
	Imagine how this would affect the community? It would be hard to be atheist in such a setting, for a oneness has been created beyond the ability of humans. It must be from God. Imagine how it would affect the church! We would all be able to know God is truly among us, for such unity could only be created by the Spirit of God and not the spirit of humanity.
</p>
<p>
	With this in mind, we do not accept the division that exists among us. We endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. But the natural question arises, “who will decide with is right to unify us?” Jesus will, by His revelation and His presence with us. If we believe He is alive and the head of His church, He can do it.

	<b>BUT PRACTICALLY....?</b>
</p>
<p>
	God is not mythology, He is reality. Here is how it works, we must all agree that one source settles the matter. For example, in a court of law we all agree the source is the law of the United States. You cannot be prosecuted for wearing pink shorts, the law does not forbid it. At work, it is the boss’s prerogative to give the last word. What is that one source among the church?
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Some have argued it is the church itself. But this is the divergence of the Roman Catholic Church and any church that has
		written down a creed. They find their authority in the hierarchy of human beings in the organization. But we cannot agree to
		this, because human’s are fallible and history has shown popes, cardinals, bishops, and priests have done and currently do
		bad things and make big theological mistakes. Just ask Galileo. So we cannot trust in human authority. What then if we
		cannot fully trust our religious leaders? If God is directly on the throne and directly ruling us as King, He is worthy of our trust.
		Hebrews 7:25-27 speaks of the perfect character of Christ will never sin against or exploit us like many religious
		organizations: “Therefore He is able also to save to the uttermost those who come unto God by Him, <i>since He</i> ever lives to make
		intercession for them. For such a high priest became us, <i>who is</i> <u>holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners</u> and made higher than
		the heavens, who does not need, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice daily, first for his own <i>sins</i> and then for the people&#39;s sins. For
		He did this once for all, when He offered up Himself.”
	</li>
	<li>
		But how do we go directly to Jesus? Well, Jesus expected this: “No one can come to Me unless the Father who has sent Me draw
		him, and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught of God.’ Therefore everyone who
		hears and learns from the Father comes to Me.” <b>–John 6:44-45</b>
	</li>
	<li>
		“Taught by God,” is the key. Some think that God just gives them directly revelation and the Spirit guides them into all truth
		without the need of being taught. They set themselves up as having a direct connection to God but contradicting His
		revelation in the Bible. This is how the Jim Jones tragedy happened, or how John Smith made the Mormons.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			But God taught us this: “For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father. Now therefore you are no longer
			strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God, and are <u>built upon the foundation of the
			apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being <i>the</i> chief cornerstone</u>, in whom every building having been fitly framed together,
			grows into a holy sanctuary in the Lord; in whom you also are built together for a dwelling place of God through <i>the</i> Spirit.”
			<b>Ephesians 2:18-22</b>
		</li>
		<li>
			We are built as Jesus’ people on the teachings of the Apostles and prophets, who all taught us about Jesus. That is why
			the 1<sup>st</sup> Century church continued steadfastly in the <u>apostle’s doctrine</u> in Acts 2. It was not about everyone doing what was
			right in their own eyes, but submitting to the teachings of Jesus Christ as recorded and relayed to us through the apostles
			and prophets. Therefore the Apostle Peter sends this to us: “If anyone speaks, <i>let it be as the</i> words of God. If anyone
			ministers, let him do it as of the ability which God gives, so that God may be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ, to whom is
			the glory, and the might forever and ever. Amen.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		Going directly to Jesus is going directly to the Bible. The Scripture is the one source for the church to understand the will of
		God. It is complete, it is preserved as God’s truth, it is without contradiction, and is the foundation of the apostles and
		prophets. So, the application is this: if someone says they have a word from God, it must be consistent with Scripture.
		Therefore, if someone says they have a word from God that we should all go to the Middle East and kill and Muslim for
		
		Jesus; we go to looking in the Book to see if it matches the apostle’s teaching. “Ah, no brother. All we find is to teach them
		about Jesus and convert them to the way, not kill them-Matthew 28:18-20.” On the other hand, if someone invites us to join
		money in sending them to Cuba to teach and preach the word of God; then we can see it is of God.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The word of God found in the Bible brings the unity that Jesus prayed for in John 17, those that believe upon Jesus through their
	[apostle’s] word. Speak to me of God’s word and then we can walk in unity. But do not add or take away from it, do not give one
	verse theology, but bring in the whole context. It sounds simple, and God has made it so to bring unity. Allow it.
