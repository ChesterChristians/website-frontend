<h2>Weddings & Funerals</h2>
<ul>
	<li>We have evangelists who would be more than willing to help you with you wedding, but we don't have a building. You get the building or the place and we'll help you on your special day. One of them has skydived before too, if that is your need.</li>
	<li>If you are looking for help for funerals, our evangelists can help you there too. Sorry for your loss, let us know what we can do.</li>
	<li>Our preachers are not that good at Bar Mitzvahs, because they're Christian. But call anyway!</li>
	<li>We have supported evangelists to provide these services for free.</li>
</ul>
